# rules

This is an implementation of
[Perl 6 rules](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perl_6_rules) for Rust. Perl 6
was supposed to break anything while ignoring backwards compatibility. Thus, the
*regex* from Perl 5 was improved into what they are now calling a framework of
*rules*. This provides more flexibility than before and is syntactically different.

A straightforward intro to Perl 6 rules is found
[here](https://github.com/perlpilot/perl6-docs/blob/master/intro/p6-regex-intro.pod).
